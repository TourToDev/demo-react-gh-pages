"# Goodbye, Clean Code\r\n\r\nJanuary 11, 2020 • ☕️ 5 min read\r\n\r\nIt was a late evening.\r\n\r\nMy colleague has just checked in the code that they’ve been writing all week. We were working on a graphics editor canvas, and they implemented the ability to resize shapes like rectangles and ovals by dragging small handles at their edges.\r\n\r\nThe code worked.\r\n\r\nBut it was repetitive. Each shape (such as a rectangle or an oval) had a different set of handles, and dragging each handle in different directions affected the shape’s position and size in a different way. If the user held Shift, we’d also need to preserve proportions while resizing. There was a bunch of math.\r\n\r\nThe code looked something like this:\r\n\r\n``` js\r\nlet Rectangle = {\r\n  resizeTopLeft(position, size, preserveAspect, dx, dy) {\r\n    // 10 repetitive lines of math\r\n  },\r\n  resizeTopRight(position, size, preserveAspect, dx, dy) {\r\n    // 10 repetitive lines of math\r\n  },\r\n  resizeBottomLeft(position, size, preserveAspect, dx, dy) {\r\n    // 10 repetitive lines of math\r\n  },\r\n  resizeBottomRight(position, size, preserveAspect, dx, dy) {\r\n    // 10 repetitive lines of math\r\n  },\r\n};\r\n\r\nlet Oval = {\r\n  resizeLeft(position, size, preserveAspect, dx, dy) {\r\n    // 10 repetitive lines of math\r\n  },\r\n  resizeRight(position, size, preserveAspect, dx, dy) {\r\n    // 10 repetitive lines of math\r\n  },\r\n  resizeTop(position, size, preserveAspect, dx, dy) {\r\n    // 10 repetitive lines of math\r\n  },\r\n  resizeBottom(position, size, preserveAspect, dx, dy) {\r\n    // 10 repetitive lines of math\r\n  },\r\n};\r\n\r\nlet Header = {\r\n  resizeLeft(position, size, preserveAspect, dx, dy) {\r\n    // 10 repetitive lines of math\r\n  },\r\n  resizeRight(position, size, preserveAspect, dx, dy) {\r\n    // 10 repetitive lines of math\r\n  },  \r\n}\r\n\r\nlet TextBlock = {\r\n  resizeTopLeft(position, size, preserveAspect, dx, dy) {\r\n    // 10 repetitive lines of math\r\n  },\r\n  resizeTopRight(position, size, preserveAspect, dx, dy) {\r\n    // 10 repetitive lines of math\r\n  },\r\n  resizeBottomLeft(position, size, preserveAspect, dx, dy) {\r\n    // 10 repetitive lines of math\r\n  },\r\n  resizeBottomRight(position, size, preserveAspect, dx, dy) {\r\n    // 10 repetitive lines of math\r\n  },\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nI see now that my “refactoring” was a disaster in two ways:\r\n\r\n* Firstly, I didn’t talk to the person who wrote it. I rewrote the code and checked it in without their input. Even if it was an improvement (which I don’t believe anymore), this is a terrible way to go about it. A healthy engineering team is constantly building trust. Rewriting your teammate’s code without a discussion is a huge blow to your ability to effectively collaborate on a codebase together.\r\n\r\n\r\n* Secondly, nothing is free. My code traded the ability to change requirements for reduced duplication, and it was not a good trade. For example, we later needed many special cases and behaviors for different handles on different shapes. My abstraction would have to become several times more convoluted to afford that, whereas with the original “messy” version such changes stayed easy as cake."
